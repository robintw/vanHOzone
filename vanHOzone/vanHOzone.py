    """
    Returns the ozone contents in matm-cm for the given latitude/longitude
    and timestamp (provided as either a datetime object or a string in any
    sensible format - I strongly recommend using an ISO 8601 format of
    yyyy-mm-dd) according to van Heuklon's Ozone model.

    The model is described in Van Heuklon, T. K. (1979). Estimating atmospheric
    ozone for solar radiation models. Solar Energy, 22(1), 63-68.

    This function uses numpy functions, so you can pass arrays and it will
    return an array of results. The timestamp argument can be either an
    array/list or a single value. If it is a single value then this will be
    used for all lat/lon values given.
